* TODO:

* Add more measurements, especially for @param, @yield and type
  validation
* Update yardstick_measure task to use the Yardstick::CLI library
  underneath.
* Output results as HTML from command line tool and Rake task
* Specify method_missing to allow public, semipublic or private even
  if its visibility is private
* Allow initialize to be public, semipublic or private regardless of
  its visibility. A constructor may not necessarily be public, and may
  not be used externally.
